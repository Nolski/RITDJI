People act differently depending on the potential consequences of their actions.
For instance, if a child is never reprimanded for stealing a candy bar from a
candy store, then they may be more likely repeat that action. Yet if you
threaten to destroy that child’s life, and take away every ounce of privilege
that he or she was born with, then that child will very likely not even enter
the store, in fear the possible dire consequences of a mistake (would you?).

Now instead of candy, lets create those limits and punishments surrounding a
tool which has defined an entire generation. This tool which has allowed us to
help coordinate efforts that allow us to help feed a starving population. It has
allowed us to cure diseases, create works of art, bring fields of scientists
together to conduct research and intelligent discussion on a scale which hasn’t
ever been seen before.

Tools like the computer and the internet live as a symbol of equality and the
abuse and blatant ignorance of acts like the CFAA, most notably the amendments
which our president is advocating for are trying to undermine that.

The malicious use of the CFAA isn’t just limited to federal cases. Most notably
is **Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz** where Sony sued Hotz
for creating and posting a method of “jail breaking” a Playstation 3 console.
This would allow users to access device capabilities (of the device that they
bought) which were normally restricted through Sony’s software.

Over the course of this case, Sony employed it’s own tactics of tracking users
who accessed their website and employing methods of tracking Hots and other
defendants in it’s case to find out where they live and sue them in their home
state.
