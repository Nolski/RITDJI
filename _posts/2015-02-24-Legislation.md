##### CFAA

The Computer Fraud and Abuse act was enacted by congress in 1986 as a method of
clarifying some additional provisions provided in 18 U.S.C. § 1030 as well as
criminalizing several additional computer related attacks.

The act has been amended a number of times including in the USA PATRIOT Act of
2001, in 2008 by the Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act, and is
currently undergoing an expansion which was proposed in 2015 by President Barack
Obama.

The CFAA focuses on criminalizing anyone who obtains information from a computer
which is considered _”protected”_.

The idea of having legislation which safeguards _“protected”_ computers isn’t
bad. We all value our privacy and sensitive information and it is reasonable to
expect laws that extend onward into the digital age to make sure that happens.

Yet the vast scope and indiscriminate use within civil courts has shown that
this law is not only overly broad but far too harsh for the crimes those who
were convicted committed.

The question isn’t whether what Swartz and James did was wrong and should have
been held accountable by the law. The question is about whether a case of civil
disobedience should be served with 50 years in jail and over a million dollars
in bail. It’s about how a child’s unmonitored exploration should be met with
jail time and removing a tool which is so commonly used that many say it should
be a utility for the rest of his life.
