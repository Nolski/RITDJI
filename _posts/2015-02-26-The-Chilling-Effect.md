People act differently depending on the potential consequences of their actions.
For instance, if a child is never disciplined for misbehaving they will likely
continue to do so but conversely if they are met with overwhelming punishment at
the slightest infringement, they will cease to seek out even the most simple of
pleasures that define a child’s life.

Now instead of children, lets enclose those limitations and punishments around a
tool which has defined an entire generation. This tool which allows us to
coordinate efforts in feeding a starving population. It helps cure diseases,
create works of art, brings scientists of different fields together to conduct
research and maintain intelligent discussions on a scale which hasn’t been seen
before.

Tools like the computer and the internet live as a symbol of equality. The
ignorant and unnuanced legislation such as the CFAA, importantly the amendments
initiated by our President, undermine that.
