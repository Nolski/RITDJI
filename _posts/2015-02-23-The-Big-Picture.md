When creating applications for a computer, programmers use a multitude of tools
and methods which have been invented by those  before us. We all stand on the
shoulders of giants to create the software that we do today. Those who write
software do it out of a sense of wonder that comes from finding or creating
something new. When legislation happens that seeks to punish crimes such as
posting documents on the internet with punishments that rival those of murder,
it becomes easy for software developers to view themselves as criminals. The
lines between exploring and breaking the law are blurring just as they do
between symptoms and sickness for a med student. 

Despite this, the software community is one that is strong and determined. For
many, the risk of prosecution does not out weigh the benefit of learning and
exploring. Even now, many still use the term “hacker” in an endearing sense,
meaning someone who can “hack together” creative solutions. In the face of a
media which paints them as criminals and terrorists, they still seek to convince
the world otherwise.
