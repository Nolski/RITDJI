Abhay doesn’t ever really plan on using his go bag. He keeps it as a fail safe,
the same as when he is securing computer systems. However, its very existance
shows how software developers are conditioned to fear the merciless application
of the law.

When creating applications for a computer, programmers use a multitude of tools
and methods which have been invented by those  before us. We all stand on the
shoulders of giants to create the software that we do today. Those who write
software do it out of a sense of wonder that comes from finding or creating
something new. When legislation is passed that seeks to punish crimes such as
posting documents on the internet with punishments that rival those of murder,
it becomes easy for software developers to view themselves as criminals. The
lines between exploring and breaking the law are blurring just as they do
between symptoms and sickness for a med student.

Despite this, the software community is one that is strong and determined. For
many, the risk of prosecution does not outweigh the benefit of learning and
exploring. Even now, many still use the term “hacker” in an endearing sense,
meaning someone who can “hack together” creative solutions. In the face of a
media which paints them as criminals and terrorists, they still seek to convince
the world otherwise.
