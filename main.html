                        <p>Satish Abhay is a student. He studies Computer Security at a leading college. In
his spare time attends a number of clubs and organizations around his school
with friends.</p>

<p>Abhay also keeps what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug-out_bag">“go bag”</a>. It’s a medium sized duffel bag
which contains several days worth of clothes, his passport, and a few hundred
dollars in cash. It’s meant to act as a quick storage of all of his bare
necessities if anything were to happen where he had to get up and leave in a
moments notice.</p>

<p>Abhay has never committed any serious crime. He was raised by a fairly well off
family with no criminal past. He doesn’t belong to any terrorist organization
and has no desire to.</p>

<p>So why would someone who doesn’t have any plans on ever committing a crime live
in an environment of duress, ready to drop his whole life and run away with
nothing but a few changes of clothes, some cash, and his passport? Does he think
that one day he will somehow snap and start committing crimes?</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_students%27_disease" target="_blank">Med
    Students’ syndrome</a> is a condition frequently reported in medical students
who perceive themselves to be experiencing the symptoms of the disease
which they are studying. Because the student surrounds themselves with deadly
conditions so frequently, they become hyper aware of those symptoms.</p>

<p>It’s this relentless subjection to the possibility of disease that breeds this
bizarre kind of paranoia. To the ordinary person, this may seem irrational but
within med schools it is fairly common.</p>

<p>The modern day perception of hackers shows them as criminals. From everything
from fantasized movies about hackers causing nuclear meltdowns, to our own
president alluding to the dangerous threat that hackers pose to our children.
Programmers are constantly tip-toeing the line between a celebrated hero who is
ushering in a digital age and a menacing terrorist hellbent on destroying
America's "freedom"  with very little distinction for what separates them.</p>

<p>It is this boundary, be it the one that separates symptoms from sickness, or
curiosity from criminality that defines this syndrome.</p>

                        </header>

<p>The depiction of info-sec professionals in pop-culture and everyday
conversation aren't the only driving force which cause public perception to be
so aggressive towards "hackers". The US Federal government has ruthlessly
prosecuted individuals, turning these individuals into examples of what can
happen if you don't fit into their view of how people in computing should
act.</p>

<p>With this mass paranoia and culture of aggression that our government has
shown towards any action which could be perceived as "hacking" has proven to be
incredibly effective at delivering incredibly harsh sentences for actions which
do not necessarily break the law.</p>

<img src="images/swartz.jpg" style="float: left; width: 250px; margin-right: 0.5em;" alt="Jonathan James"/>
<p>Aaron Swartz is a significant individual in the computing community.
Co-founding <a href="https://reddit.com">reddit.com</a>, and
developing the RSS 1.0 spec which powers nearly every blogging service on the
internet, he has published widely cited papers such as his landmark analysis of
Wikipedia <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia"><em>”Who
Writes Wikipedia”</em></a>. Most notably he founded the organization <a
href="https://demandprogress.org/">Demand Progress</a> which spearheaded
efforts against the SOPA/PIPA bills which threatened to crack down many forms
of online content distribution.</p>

<p>Swartz was first noticed by federal law enforcement agencies for downloading and
releasing about 2.7 million <em>public</em> federal court documents stored in PACER.
Although the court which housed the terminals that could be used to access the
documents knew of serious security vulnerabilities (one of which, was exploited
by Swartz to download the documents), an FBI investigation still ensued.
Fortunately the investigation didn’t go anywhere since the documents “leaked”
were in-fact, public.</p>

<p>Still, this ended up putting Swartz on the radar of many powerful and
influential organizations. Swartz was later caught downloading a large number of
academic papers from JSTOR online, obtained from his own account provided to him
by being on campus at MIT, even though he was a research fellow at Harvard
university.</p>

<p>On the night of January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested near the Harvard campus by
MIT police and a U.S. Secret Service agent. What followed was a string of court
cases accusing him of everything from 
<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0711/MIT_also_pressing_charges_against_hacking_suspect.html" target="_blank">breaking and entering to grand larceny.</a>
</p>

<p>On September 12, 2012, federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment adding
nine more felony counts, which increased Swartz’s maximum criminal exposure to
50 years of imprisonment and $1 million in fines.</p>

<p>Swartz committed suicide on January 11, 2013.</p>

<h6 id="jonathan-james">Jonathan James</h6>

<img src="images/james.jpg" style="float: right; width: 250px;" alt="Jonathan James"/>
<p>Jonathan James is the first juvenile who was incarcerated for cybercrime. James
installed a backdoor in a server in Dulles, Virginia which would sniff packets
passing to and from DTRA (Defence Threat Reduction Agency) employees.</p>

<p>James house was raided on the evening of January 26, 2000 by agents of the DoD,
NASA, and the Pinecrest Police Dept. He was sentenced to 6 months of house
arrest and probation until the age of 18. He was 16 years old on the date of his
sentencing.</p>

<p>James was banned from using computers for recreational purposes. While this may
seem like a small price to pay, for a child to be so fascinated with a subject
that they can intercept packets from an agency and download the source code for
the software which runs the international space station, this sentence is
devastating.</p>


<p>Both Attorney General Janet Reno and prosecuting attorney Guy Lewis issued
statements claiming the James case was proof the Justice Department was willing
to get tough with juvenile offenders accused of cybercrime.</p>

<p>After a series of massive computer systems intrusions performed by a ring of
hackers, the secret service began investigating James, looking for any
connection to the crimes. Though James denied having any connection, the secret
service raided both his brother’s and girlfriend’s houses.</p>

<p>Although they apparently discovered no connection to the intrusion, they did
discover a legally registered firearm, which they did not take, and notes
indicating he had considered killing himself; James’ father would later say that
his son had been prone to depression.</p>

<p>On May 18, 2008, Jonathan James was found dead in his shower with a
self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.</p>

                        <h5 id="cfaa">CFAA</h5>

<p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) was enacted by Congress in 1986 as a
method of clarifying some additional provisions provided in existing computer
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">fraud law</a> as well as
criminalizing several additional computer related attacks.</p>

<p>The act has been amended a number of times including in the
<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf" target="_blank">USA PATRIOT Act of
    2001</a>, in 2008 by the <a href="http://www.theiacp.org/investigateid/pdf/appendices/The-Identity-Theft-Enforcement-and-Restitution-Act-of-2008.pdf">Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act</a>, and is
currently undergoing an expansion which was proposed in 2015 by President Barack
Obama.</p>


<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L4_7Vex0FCU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The CFAA focuses on criminalizing anyone who obtains information from a computer
which is considered <em>”protected”</em>.</p>

<p>The idea of having legislation which safeguards <em>“protected”</em> computers isn’t
bad. We all value our privacy and sensitive information, and it is reasonable to
expect laws that extend onward into the digital age to make sure that happens.</p>

<p>The malicious use of the CFAA isn’t just limited to federal cases. Most notably
is <strong>Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz</strong> where Sony sued Hotz
for creating and posting a method of “jail breaking” a PlayStation 3 console.
This would allow users to access device capabilities (of the device that they
bought) which were normally restricted through Sony’s software.</p>

<p>Over the course of this case, Sony employed it’s own methods of tracking Hotz
and other defendants who accessed their website to find out where they live and
sue them in their home state.</p>

<p>Yet the law’s vast scope and indiscriminate use within civil courts has shown
that it is not only overly broad, but far too harsh for the “crimes” which were
committed.</p>

<p>The question isn’t whether what Swartz and James did was wrong or if they should
have been held accountable by the law. The question is whether a case of
civil disobedience should be served with 50 years in jail and over a million
dollars in bail. It’s about how a child’s unmonitored exploration should be met
with jail time and removing a tool essential for modern life.</p>

                        <p>Abhay doesn’t ever really plan on using his go bag. He keeps it as a fail safe,
the same as when he is backing up computer systems. However, its very existence
shows how software developers are conditioned to fear the merciless application
of the law.</p>

<p>When creating applications for a computer, programmers use a multitude of tools
and methods which have been invented by those who came before us. We all stand
on the shoulders of giants to create the software that we do today. Many of
those who write software do it out of a sense of wonder that comes from finding
or creating something new. When legislation is passed that seeks to punish
crimes such as posting documents on the internet with punishments that rival
those of murder, it becomes easy for software developers to view themselves as
criminals.</p>

<p>It’s cases like Aaron Swartz, who was being tried for up to 35 years
in prison for downloading a large amount of files that send a clear message to
any who understand software security that they are the enemy. It’s cases such as
Deric Lostutter who exposed proof in the Steubenville rape case and was handed a
sentence which was <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/06/07/2119171/anonymous-hacker-steubenville-jail/">five times the length</a>
of the football players who were convicted of raping an unconscious teenager.</p>

<p>The lines between exploring and breaking the law are blurring just as
they do between symptoms and sickness for a med student.</p>

<p>Despite this, the software community is one that is strong and determined. For
many, the risk of prosecution does not outweigh the benefit of learning and
exploring. Even now, many still use the term “hacker” in an endearing sense,
meaning someone who can “hack together” creative solutions. In the face of a
media which paints them as criminals and terrorists, they still seek to convince
the world otherwise.</p>
